The  above  described  summarization  method  has  two  significant  disadvantages.  At  first  it  is  necessary  to  use  the  same  number  of  dimensions  as  is  the  number  of  sentences  we  want  to  choose  for  a  summary.  However,  the  higher  is  the  number  of  dimensions  of  reduced  space,  the less significant topic we take into a summary. This disadvantage turns into an advantage only in the case when we know how many different topics has the original document and we choose  the  same  number  of  sentences  into  a  summary.  The  second  disadvantage  is  that  a  sentence  with  large  index  values,  but  not  the  largest  (it  doesnâ€™t  win  in  any  dimension),  will  not be chosen although its content is for the summary very suitable.
